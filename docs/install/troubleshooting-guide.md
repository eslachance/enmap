# Troubleshooting Guide

Please make sure to read the [install page](/install) **VERY CAREFULLY**! This should solve all the issues you face. If not carry on, but don't say we didn't tell you.

## It's Taking Suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuper Long to Install! Whats up with that?

Your computer has to install some programs and then build everything from source. This is going to take a while depending on your computer speed. Patience is key. We can't speed it up for you. It may look like its frozen but it is not.

Some tips: Make sure you are doing this install on a fast hard drive (ideally SSD, but HDD will work fine) and **not on a USB Key** or removable media.

## command failed downloading python or build tools

`Please restart this script in an administrative Powershel!` means you did not read the [install page](/install) correctly.

## MSB3428: Could not load the Visual C++ component "VCBuild.exe"

Looks like someone hasn't follows the [installation instructions](/install) correctly...
